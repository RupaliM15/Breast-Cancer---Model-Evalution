# Breast-Cancer---Model-Evalution

Load the 'Breast_Cancer_Dataset.csv'
perform the following tasks:

1. Identify the null values and remove the null rows and columns by using the dropna() function

2. Encode the 'diagnosis' column using the LabelEncoder()

3. Considering the 'diagnosis' column as the target, separate the target variable and the feature vectors

4. Split the dataset into the training set and test set in a 70:30 ratio

5. Building a Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree (CART), K-NN, SVM, and RandomForestClassifier models; Also print their accuracies

6. Calculate and plot the confusion matrix

7. Calculate the ROC_AUC score based on the False Positive Rate (FPR) and True Positive Rate (TPR)

8. Plot the ROC Curve using the Matplotlib library

9. Calculate the F1 Score

10.Calculate and Print the Precision, Recall, and F1 score using the classification_report() function
